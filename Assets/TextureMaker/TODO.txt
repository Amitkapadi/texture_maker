TODO:

Texture Maker:
    -- Add Voronoi diagram feature.
    -- Texture name field.
    -- Auto increment on save?
    -- Add Mandelbrot fractals. maybe julia sets?
    -- Optimize - maybe run it on shaders???
    -- Hilbert Curve???
    -- Musgrave texture???
    -- Add nodes editor?
    

        -> Tools tab:
            -- Crop and Resize.
            -- Textures masking (different sized blending textures or masks???).
            -- Rounded edge.
            -- Paint alpha??
            -- Add multiply, additive and overlay blending options.

    -- Bugs:
        -- Fix tile colors not correct sometimes around the edges of each tile there is some kind of bleeding.
        -- Fix preview texture is drawn from bottom-left, we want it from top-left.
        -- Noise textures preview section is not particularly correct (because of the texture size, they depend on texture size).
        -- when Use as mask is ticked we want to blend colors first then apply mask at the result.



        if we have two masks for the 4 textures.
        we mask the first two then mask the second two.
        then blend the output together based on the second mask output alpha value.
